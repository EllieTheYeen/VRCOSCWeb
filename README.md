This is a web interface to VRChat through OSC (Open Sound Control) that lets you control parameters and also move your avatar (Using keyboard). It is what I use to debug my avatars. It will load all the avatar parameters up when you switch avatar and let you see them as they get changed ingame

Here is an example of how it looks like and yeah the design might not be the best but feel free to submit a pull request if you make a design for it since that could be very useful

![Green box saying online. Two textboxes below where one says "Write text here and press enter to chat" and the other says "Place cursor here for control with keyboard WASD". It then says DebugAvatar and has various buttons and sliders saying a data type then butt, on and off and some other things have sliders instead and shows the yellow text "unknown" after them](example.png)
